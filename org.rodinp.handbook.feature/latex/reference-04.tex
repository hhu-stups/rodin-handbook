\section{Proving}
\label{reference_04}

This section should enable the user to understand proofs in Event-B. In the first iteration, we won't go into detail when it comes to proof rules and tactics. We just refer to the already existing Wiki sites.
  
\subsection{Introduction}

What does a proof in Event-B looks like? (Goal, proof tree, hypothesis, selected hypothesis, \ldots)

\subsection{Proof rules}

(first only a link to the Wiki page)

\subsection{Proof tactics}

(first only a link to the Wiki page)

\subsection{The provers (PP, ML, New-PP)}

We just give a very brief over the existing provers. (What are their strengths/weaknesses).
