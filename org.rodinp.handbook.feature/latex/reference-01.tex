\section{The Rodin Platform}
\label{reference_01}

This Chapter should give the user an overview about the UI elements he might encounter.

\subsection{Eclipse in General}

Just references to other resources.

\subsection{The Event-B Perspective}

The Event-B perspective: We briefly describe the various views (Event-B explorer, structure editor, outline view, symbol view) and their content. We want to cover every element of each view (like buttons, entry fields, etc.), but for the underlying theory we link to the other reference sections. The relevant menu entries are also described.
 

\subsection{The Proving Perspective}

We do basically the same as for the Event-B perspective. The views are proof tree, goal, control and statistics.
 
\subsection{Preferences}

We briefly describe what preference can be set for Rodin. For their deeper meaning, we'll refer to the other sections (esp. the prover settings).
