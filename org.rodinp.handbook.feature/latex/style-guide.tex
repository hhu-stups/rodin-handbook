\subsection{Style Guide}

\info{For now, we will manage the style guide as \LaTeX together with the rest of the documentation.  We may take it out upon publication.}

\subsubsection{General Stylistic Guidelines}

\begin{itemize}
	\item Use the ``we'' form.
	\item Images must be no more than 600 pixels in width (for HTML version)  This is fairly easy for bitmaps (screenshot), pay attention for vector images.
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{\LaTeX Styling}

\begin{itemize}
	\item Try to avoid fancy \LaTeX formatting, as Plastex (used for generating HTML) is temperamental.  Especially macros don't always work, and sometimes the result is just ugly.
	\item We have the option to use different files for PDF and HTML generation, but we would generally prefer not to do this.  Look at \texttt{bsymb.sty} and \texttt{plastex-bsymb.sty} as an example.
	\item Every section should have a label, reflecting the section name, all lowercase, spaces replaced with underscores (\_).
	\item Don't create subdirectories in the \texttt{latex} folder, as the scripts cannot always deal with them.
	\item Put images in the \texttt{img} folder.  Feel free to create additional directory structures underneath.
	\item Files other than images (e.g. Event-B projects) TODO - we have to figure out whether to keep them in svn (then they won't be accessible from PDFs) or on the Wiki (then they won't be accessible offline).
	\item Don't use hyperlinks for cross-references, but linked section numbers (generated with \texttt{\\ref{}}.  This is necessary for the print documentation to be useful.
\end{itemize}
