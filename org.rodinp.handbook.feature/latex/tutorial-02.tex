\subsection{Install Rodin for the first time}

\subsubsection{Step 1: Download}

The first step is of to download Rodin. Rodin is available for download at the \href{http://sourceforge.net/projects/rodin-b-sharp/files/
Core_Rodin_Platform/}{download page}. 

Rodin is available for the following systems:

\begin{itemize}
	\item Windows 32bit (rodin-*-win32.win32.x86.zip)
	\item Mac OS 64bit (rodin-*-macosx.cocoa.x86\_64.zip)
	\item Linux 32bit (rodin-*-linux.gtk.x86.zip)
\end{itemize}

Just download the zip file for your system anywhere on your PC.

\info{It is recommended that you download the latest stable version.}

As already mentioned in Section \ref{subsection_eclipse} the GUI of an Eclipse application consists of Views, Editors, Toolbars, Quickview, Perspectives and many more elements. We name the different Rodin GUI elements (i.e. Views) which are visible after starting Rodin for the first time and explain their functions:

\begin{itemize}
	\item \textbf{Menu bar (\ref{menu_bar}):} The menu bar of Rodin provides for instance file and edit operations.
	\item \textbf{Tool bar (\ref{tool_bar}):} The tool bar provides short curts for familiar commands like save, print, undo and redo.
	\item \textbf{Event-B Explorer (\ref{eventb_explorer}):} The Event-B Explorer shows the projects' (\ref{project}) tree structures. It has projects as main entries and for each one its corresponding project files.
	\item \textbf{Outline View (\ref{outline_view}):} A view, used to view the outline of the active editor or file respectively.
	\item \textbf{Rodin Problems View(\ref{rodin_problems_view}):} The Rodin Problems View shows problems (i.e. syntax errors) in the active editor.
	\item \textbf{Symbols View(\ref{symbols_view}):} A view that shows a list of available mathematical symbols which can be used in conjunction with the mathematical notation (\ref{mathematical_notation}).
	\item \textbf{Editor View(\ref{editor_view}):} The editor view contains the active editor.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Install new plugins}

This sections shows how to install new plugins for Rodin. We show this on the example of the Atelier B Provers plugin (\ref{atelier_b_provers}). 

Open the Install Manager of Eclipse (\ref{eclipse}) \textsf{Help $\rangle$ Install New Software...}. Select the Atelier B Provers update site in the field \textsf{Work with}, mark the Atelier B Provers entry and click on the \textsf{Next} button. Follow the installation instruction to install the plugin. After installing the plugin you will be asked to restart Rodin in order to finalize the installation.
