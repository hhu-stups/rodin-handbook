\section{Expanding the Traffic Light System: Contexts and Refinement}
\label{tutorial_7}

\tick{\textbf{Goals:} We apply what we learned in the previous section by introducing a context with traffic light colors, and a refinement to integrate them. We will introduce another refinement for the push buttons.}

\subsection{Data Refinement}

We will continue the example from Section~\ref{tutorial_3}, where we built a simplified model of a traffic light controller.  The model was simplified because we abstracted the traffic lights to TRUE and FALSE, and a number of features were still missing.

We will introduce data refinement in this section.  The objective is to create a mapping between the abstract traffic light values and actual colors.
