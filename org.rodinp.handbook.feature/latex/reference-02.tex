\section{Event-B (Modeling notation)}
\label{reference_02}

\subsection{Contexts}

\subsubsection{Sets}

Introducing sets, with a comment about how to add enumerated sets.

\subsubsection{Constants and axioms (with theorems), which POs are generated}
   
\subsubsection{Extending a context}

\subsection{Models}

\subsubsection{Variables and invariants (with theorems), generated POs}

\subsubsection{Seeing a context}

\subsubsection{Refining a model}

Refines clause, gluing invariant, general picture of refinement with pointers to the event below, re-use of variables.

\subsubsection{Events}

All aspects of events are covered: Parameters, guards and actions, generated POs, refinement (again with generated POs, re-use of parameters, witnesses), status (normal/convergent/anticipated), merging of events.

\subsubsection{Termination}

How to prove termination by the model's variant and the status of events.
  
\subsection{Generated proof obligations}

We give a brief overview about what POs are generated where. This should help the user to identify the reason of a PO when he just know its label.
