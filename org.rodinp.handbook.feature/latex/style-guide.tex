\section{Style Guide}

\info{For now, we will manage the style guide as \LaTeX~together with the rest of the documentation.  We may take it out upon publication.}

\subsubsection{General Stylistic Guidelines}

\begin{itemize}
	\item The Conventions (\ref{conventions}) are part of the style guide.
	\item Use the ``we'' form.
	\item Images must be no more than 700 pixels in width (for HTML version)  This is fairly easy for bitmaps (screenshot), pay attention to this regarding how plasTeX converts vector images.
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Sections}

\begin{itemize}
	\item We have a small number of well-defined chapters, the top level structuring element.
	\item sections and subsections are numbered.  In the HTML-Versions, they are broken into subpages.
    \item subsubsections do not receive numbers and are not broken into subpages in the HTML.  Keep this in mind regarding both the reading flow and page sizes.
	\item Avoid linking (ref) to subsubsections, as they don't have a number.  Latex will instead provide a link to the next higher element.  It works, but could create confusion.
	\item Generally, we should avoid gaps in the hierarchy (i.e. having a subsubsection in a section without a subsection in between).  \footnote{Coincidentally, this style guide violates this rule. Reason: We want the style guide not broken into subpages, but the proper hierarchy is a section.}
\end{itemize}


\subsubsection{\LaTeX Styling}

\begin{itemize}
	\item Try to avoid fancy \LaTeX formatting, as PlasTeX (used for generating HTML) is temperamental.  Especially macros don't always work, and sometimes the result is just ugly.
	\item We have the option to use different files for PDF and HTML generation, but we would generally prefer not to do this.  Look at \texttt{bsymb.sty} and \texttt{plastex-bsymb.sty} as an example.
	\item Every section should have a label, reflecting the section name, all lowercase, spaces replaced with underscores (\_).
	\item Don't create subdirectories in the \texttt{latex} folder, as the scripts cannot always deal with them.
	\item Put images in the \texttt{img} folder.  Feel free to create additional directory structures underneath.
	\item Files other than images (e.g. Event-B projects) TODO - we have to figure out whether to keep them in svn (then they won't be accessible from PDFs) or on the Wiki (then they won't be accessible offline).
	\item Don't use hyperlinks for cross-references, but linked section numbers (generated with \texttt{\\ref{}}.  This is necessary for the print documentation to be useful.
\end{itemize}
