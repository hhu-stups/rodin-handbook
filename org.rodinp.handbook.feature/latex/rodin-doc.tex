\chapter{Introduction}

This handbook provides documentation for users of the Rodin toolset, which allows working with Event-B models.

Event-B is a formal method for system-level modelling and analysis. Key features of Event-B are the use of set theory as a modelling notation, the use of refinement to represent systems at different abstraction levels and the use of mathematical proof to verify consistency between refinement levels.

The Rodin Platform is an Eclipse-based IDE for Event-B that provides effective support for refinement and mathematical proof. The platform is open source, contributes to the Eclipse framework and is further extensible with plugins. 

This handbook covers the use of the core platform.  Documentation for developers and regarding extensions can be found in the Rodin wiki (\ref{rodin_wiki}).

What you see here is a working draft of the documentation.  We are grateful for any feedback that you may have (\ref{feedback}).

\section{Overview}

This handbook consists of five parts:

\begin{description}
	\item[Introduction] You are reading the introduction right now.  It helps you to orient yourself and to find information quickly.
	\item[Tutorial] If you are completely new to Rodin, the tutorial is a good way to get up to speed quickly.  It guides you through the installation and usage of the tool and gives you an overview of the Event-B modeling notation.
	\item[Reference] The reference section provides comprehensive documentation of Rodin, and its components.
	\item[Frequently Asked Questions] Common issues are listed by category in the FAQ.
	\item[Index] We included an index especially for the print version of the handbook.  In the electronic versions, you may want to try the search functionality as well.
\end{description}

\subsection{Formats of this Handbook}
\label{handbook_formats}

The handbook comes in various formats:

\begin{description}
	\item[Eclipse Help] The Rodin Handbook is shipped with Rodin and can be accessed through the help system.  The handbook will be updated with the standard Rodin update mechanism.
	\item[Online Help] You can access the handbook online at \url{http://handbook.event-b.org}.
	\item[PDF Help] Both online versions also include a link to the PDF version of the handbook.
	\item[Phyiscal Book] If there is enough interest, we may make the handbook available through a print-on-demand retailer.
\end{description}

\subsection{Rodin Wiki}
\label{rodin_wiki}

This handbook is complemented by the Rodin wiki (\url{http://wiki.event-b.org/}).  Sometimes, the handbook will refer to the wiki for more information.  Also, plugin and developer information is usually located in the wiki.

\subsection{Feedback}
\label{feedback}

All online versions of the handbook contain a button or link for feedback.  Work on the handbook will continue until at least January 2012, so your feedback will be read and will help to improve this handbook.  You can also submit feedback via email to \texttt{rodin-handbook@formalmind.com}.

\section{Foreword}
\label{foreword}

It would be nice to recruit somebody for the foreword - maybe Cliff and/or Jean-Raymond.

\section{Conventions}
\label{conventions}

We use the following conventions in this manual:

\tick{Checklists and Milestones are designated with a tick. Here we summarize what we want to learn or should have learned so far.}
\info{Useful information and tricks are designated by the information sign.}
\warning{Potential problems and warnings are designated by a warning sign.}
\pencil{Examples and Code are designated by a pencil.}

We use \texttt{typewriter} font for file names and directories.

We use \textsf{sans serif font} for GUI elements like menus and buttons.  Menu actions are depicted by a chain of elements, separated by ``$\rangle$'', e.g. \textsf{File $\rangle$ New $\rangle$ Event-B Component}.

\section{Acknowledgements}
\label{sec:acknowledgements}

The content of this handbook has been growing since the formation of the European Union IST Project RODIN in 2004.  Giving credit to every contributor is almost impossible and attempting to do so would almost certainly omit some people, which would contradict the spirit of this work.  It should be sufficient to say that we extend our gratitude to all contributors to the Rodin Wiki (\ref{rodin_wiki}). In particular, we would like to thank Systerel\footnote{\url{http://www.systerel.fr}} for their significant contributions to the handbook as they have been the main driver behind the tool and its documentation.

We would also like to thank Cliff Jones, who never gave up the quest to improve the Rodin documentation.

The icons that you find throughout this handbook were created by Pixel-Mixer\footnote{\url{http://pixel-mixer.com/}}, who provides them for free.  Thanks!

The cover picture was taken by \href{http://www.skaffari.fi/}{Miikka Skaffari}, who made it available via the Creative Commons by-nc license, depicting a sculpture by Rodin.  Thanks!

\section{DEPLOY}
\label{deploy}

This work has been sponsored by the DEPLOY project\footnote{\url{http://www.deploy-project.eu/}}.  DEPLOY is a European Commission Information and Communication Technologies FP7 project.

The overall aim of the EC Information and Communication Technologies FP7 DEPLOY Project is to make major advances in engineering methods for dependable systems through the deployment of formal engineering methods. Formal engineering methods enable greater mastery of complexity than found in traditional software engineering processes. It is the central role played by mechanically-analysed formal models throughout the system development flow that enables mastery of complexity.

As well as leading to big improvements in system dependability, greater mastery of complexity also leads to greater productivity by reducing the expensive test-debug-rework cycle and by facilitating increased reuse of software.

The goal of the project is to achieve and evaluate industrial take-up of DEPLOY's methods and tools (which started with DEPLOY's industrial partners) as well as to perform further research on methods and tools that is considered necessary.
